## BuberBreakfast

Followed [Amichai](https://github.com/amantinband)'s [FreeCodeCamp Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmDJIooZjBE) for .NET REST APIs (Tutorial Code [here](https://github.com/amantinband/buber-breakfast)).

After spending some time on Clean Architecture, it was refreshing to get back to the basics. Overall, this tutorial is a highly recommended quick start to .NET APIs, with a couple of noteworthy points:
- The benefits of .http files for local testing may potentially outweigh that of Swagger.
- This tutorial also demonstrated the usefulness of Amichai's [ErrorOr](https://github.com/amantinband/error-or) Nuget package.

.NET 8 was used for the code-along even though the tutorial used .NET 6.

Also started working in VSCode, and with DotNet via the CLI.
